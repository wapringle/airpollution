SLIDE 1,1,,,,,The atmosphere acts like a jacket to keep the planet warm.  If there was no atmosphere the Earth would be about -18 C. Brr… ,,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 1,2,,,,,"If the earth was the size on an apple, the atmosphere would be thinner than the skin of the apple.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 2,1,49,75,56,88,"Nitrogen is what is known as an inert gas; this means that it doesn't normally undergo chemical reactions.   When we breath in Nitrogen, it doesn't react in our lungs, and therefore doesn't affect our bodies in any way.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 2,2,86,75,92,91,"Why is the sky blue?  The light coming from the sun is white, so it contains all the colours of the rainbow.  But the nitrogen and oxygen molecules scatter blue light more than any other colours, giving the sky it's usual blue colour.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 3,1,,,,,When we breath our lungs take in air inside our bodies.,,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 3,2,,,,,"Inside the lungs, some of the oxygen in the air passes into your blood.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 3,3,,,,,Your heart pumps the oxygen in the blood around to body to where it is needed in your muscels and organs.,,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 3,4,,,,,"The amount of air we can blow out of our lungs is called our ""lung capacity"".  If you have a large lung capacity then oxygen can travel round our bodies faster.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 3,5,,,,,We can increase our lung capacity by exersizing regularly,,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 3,6,,,,,Exposure to air pollution can reduce childrens' lung capacity,,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 4,1,,,,,The particles are so small you could fit 10 of then in the width of a single hair on your head.,,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 4,2,,,,,"Particulate matter is too tiny to be seen by eye, but can be seen under a microscope.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 5,1,,,,,"Under a microscope particulate matter can be very beautiful, the particles can be different shapes and sizes and are formed from lots of different materials. ",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 5,2,,,,,"In 2018 a volcano in Iceland errupted giving out so much volcanic ash that airoplanes we not able to fly through it safely.  In total About 20 countries closed their airspace to commercial planes, and it affected approximately 10 million travellers.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 5,3,,,,,"Pollen particles are too big to pass into our lungs and damage our health in the way pollution does, but they can enter our noses and cause hay fever, which can be unpleasant for sufferers.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 6,1,,,,,"""Air pollution"" is defined as any substance that humans put in the atmosphere that can have a harmful effect.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 6,2,,,,,"Some air pollution is from gases, but particulate matter air pollution is one of the most dangerous for our health.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 7,1,,,,,"FACTORY:  Many industrial processes produce air pollution.  Producing energy from coal produced sulfur dioxide gas, which can form particulate matter pollution.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 7,1,,,,,BBQ:  When you cook on a BBQ the grey smoke is full of particulate matter.  On a summers eventing when lots of people have BBQs air pollution can increase a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 7,1,,,,,"HOUSE:  When we heat our houses using oil, gas or electricty it doesn't make pollution at the house, instead pollution is produced in the factories where the oil, gas and electricty are made.    Burning coal and wood does make air pollution.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 7,1,,,,,FIRE:  The smoke from fires contains tiny particles of soot that contributes to particulate matter pollution.  Some fires are natural (caused by lightning) but many are man made.  Sometimes fires start on moorlands when people use disposable BBQs.  There fires are dangerous and contribute to air pollution.,,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 7,1,,,,,"CAR:  Cars, buses, trucks and lorries all produce air pollution.  Diesel cars normally produce more particulate matter than peterol cars.  We can reduce the amount of pollution we create by walking and cycling instead of driving, as much as possible.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 7,1,,,,,"FIREWORKS:  Fireworks are beatiful and fun to watch, but they also produce a lot of smoke, which adds to air pollution.  Can you think of which nights of the year this might be most important?",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 7,1,,,,,"TREE:  Trees are great for the environment because they remove the greenhouse gas Carbon Dioxide.   They can also indirectly help reduce air pollution - some trees can ""filter"" particulate matter out of the air.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 8,1,,,,,"Respiration is another word for breathing.  So ""respitory illnesses"" are any illness that affect how well people can breathe.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 8,2,,,,,A study by Born in Bradford found that air pollution may be responsible for more than a third of childhood asthma cases in Bradford.,,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 8,3,,,,,"During the COVID-19 lockdown, air pollution concentrations fell in many cities.  During this time doctors found that many people with asthma reported that their symptoms were less severe than normal.",,,,,,,,,,,
SLIDE 9,1,,,,,The smallest particles are the most dangerous for health as they are small enough to pass into your lungs,,,,,,,,,,,
